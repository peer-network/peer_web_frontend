# 🔒 Gitleaks Pre-Commit Hook (Web Frontend)

This repository uses **[Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)** to prevent secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens, etc.) from being committed.

---

## 🚀 Setup

Run the setup script once:

```bash
chmod +x setup-hooks.sh
./setup-hooks.sh
```

This will:

- Configure Git to use .githooks/ as the hooks directory.
- Make .githooks/pre-commit executable.
- Ensure gitleaks is installed (v8.28.0).

If missing, the script will download the correct binary for your OS/architecture.

Confirm the hook is ready.

🛡️ Pre-Commit Scan
On every git commit, the hook will:

- Run a Gitleaks scan on staged changes only.
- Block the commit if potential secrets are detected.
- Write results to .gitleaks_out/gitleaks-precommit.json.

If a commit is blocked:

- Check .gitleaks_out/gitleaks-precommit.json for details.
- Remove or mask the secret before retrying.

Do not bypass with git commit --no-verify — CI will still block your PR.

###

Docker Fallback

If a local Gitleaks binary is missing, the pre-commit hook will fall back to Docker:

docker run --rm -i -v "$(pwd)":/repo ghcr.io/gitleaks/gitleaks:v8.28.0 detect ...

###
✅ Verifying Installation
To check that everything is set up correctly:

```
gitleaks version
```
# should print: 8.28.0

###
🧹 Ignore False Positives
If Gitleaks flags something that is not a real secret:

Talk to your Team Lead / DevOps.

They can add an exception to gitleaks.toml.

With this setup, secrets are scanned locally before every commit and again in CI, ensuring strong security across the repo. 🔐
